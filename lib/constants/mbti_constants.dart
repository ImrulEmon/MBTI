    'Right brain or creative thinkers gather information by feelings and intuition. This information is retained by using images and patterns and are able to visualize the whole idea as we gather our research.The thought processes appear illogical and meandering because they are emotional, intuitive, abstract and laterally connected. Analysis of this information or problem-solving often involves free association and, while the solutions may be quite innovative, the route traveled to reach this conclusion would be impossible for a more rational left brain thinker to follow. Visual thinkers do not use a step-by-step process to gather information -- rather it is visually gathered all at once which makes organization of this information and verbalizing the accumulated data, either in written or verbal form, difficult. Right brain thinkers are best able to express themselves using art, music or dance.';

Their brain processes are deductive, rational, concrete and analytically connected. Left brain thinkers express themselves with concise words, numerical and written formulas and technological systems.\n\nModern scientists know that your left brain is your verbal and rational brain while your right brain is you nonverbal and intuitive brain. We require special functions from both sides of our brains to accomplish most tasks in our daily lives. There are some nonverbal tasks -- such as drawing, painting, dancing and music, in which our right brain excels and you\'d be best to shelve your left brain functions to prevent interference by your rational side.\n\nWhile most people can be categorized as left or right brain thinkers, there are exercises that can help you develop and nurture your intuitive side.';
